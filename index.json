	"content": " Project Dovetail™ is an Open Source application for blockchain smart contracts Developing blockchain solutions with today’s technology is challenging, given the lack of tooling and standardization. Project Dovetail™ by TIBCO LABS™ addresses these issues by providing a graphical interface for modeling smart contracts, making them easier to write, visualize, test, and audit, all without deep programming experience. Logic is abstracted from low-level code, and contracts can be deployed into different blockchain stacks with little or no change. On-chain and off-chain computation can become more seamless, time to market is improved, and the risk of technology lock-in is reduced. Project Dovetail makes your smart contracts smarter. \nWhat are Smart Contracts There are many definitions and descriptions of smart contracts, as each blockchain framework tends to implement this capability in its own way (if it does implement this feature at all). However, generally speaking, smart contracts (at least from an enterprise / permissioned perspective) may be thought of as application or business logic (defined in code) that runs within the context of a blockchain network itself. The idea is to automate the processing of blockchain transactions across the network, use the logic to determine if a transaction will get written to the ledger, and to maintain accuracy, compliance, and trust. In essence, smart contracts represent a method for controlling how changes are made to the underlying blockchain, in a non-centralized and (potentially) untrustworthy environment. Supply chain transaction tracking, healthcare revenue cycle management, consumer contract execution, and government interactions are all areas in which smart contracts (business logic) may be applied. Remember, however, that \u0026ldquo;smart contracts\u0026rdquo; are not necessarily \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; (depends on the code) nor \u0026ldquo;contracts\u0026rdquo; (as they may not be viewed as legal contracts). Thus, the term can be a bit misleading :)\nProject Dovetail Project Dovetail™ is a framework that allows for the end to end design, development, testing, and deployment of blockchain smart contracts. Project Dovetail™ allows you to develop smart contracts based on a series of models, helping to:\n Increase security since the modeling abstraction layer will allow for reusable and tested code derived from the model. Simplify development via an extendable abstraction layer (flow model) Decouple your code from the underlying blockchain technology Reduce the amount of code needed Increase visibility and audit-ability Allow customizable modeling for your industry Expose a better UI for the design of smart contracts  Dovetail Core Dovetail is based on TIBCO FLOGO™, an event-driven app framework used to develop apps for the cloud \u0026amp; IoT edge. It can also be thought of as a lightweight app kernel used by open source \u0026amp; commercial solutions like Dovetail here. The trigger used is based on the cli to generate or transpile your smart contract logic into blockchain technologies languages : R3 Corda, HyperLedger Fabric\u0026hellip;\nDovetail Core provides the following key benefits:\n⛓ Action chaining enables communication between one or more capabilities in a single, sub 10MB binary! 🏗 Common contribution model build activities and triggers that can be leveraged by all capabilities 🔨 Extensible easily extend the capabilities available by building your own action using the common interfaces\nDovetail Core Contribution Model Dovetail™ Core exposes three principal contribution interfaces that enable developers to build common capabilities and functionality. These contribution interfaces include:\n Connector Interface a common interface for importing predefined schemas into Dovetail, Hyperledger Composer Connector is an example. Trigger Interface a common interface for building event-consumers that dispatch events to one or more actions. The Smart Contract TXN Trigger is an example of a trigger. Activity Interface a common interface for exposing common application logic in a reusable manner. Think of this as a function, such as write to ledger, publish events, etc that can be used by all Dovetail apps.  Repos Project Dovetail consists of the following sub-projects available as separate repos:\n dovetail-cli: Command line tools for building Dovetail apps \u0026amp; extensions dovetail-contrib: Dovetail contributions/extensions dovetail-java-lib: Dovetail java runtime for smart contract flows  Dovetail Flows Dovetail Flows provides smart contract logic design capabilities and includes the following key highlights.\n🌈 Painless development Visual modeler with step-back debugging capabilities \u0026amp; elegant DSL ⚙️ Ultra-light process engine for conditional flow control\nGetting Started We\u0026rsquo;ve made getting started with Dovetail Flows as easy as possible.

	"content": " In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to model, implement and test smart contracts on distributed ledger technology platform of your choice. The example is a simple \u0026ldquo;I owe you\u0026rdquo; use case, the issuer of an IOU is obligated to pay the owner of the IOU amount issued, the ownership of the IOU can be transferred by current owner, and all transactions will be recorded on the ledger.\nBefore getting started, you should have Project Dovetail™ Studio and Project Dovetail™ CLI installed, and your development environment setup.\n1. Model IOU Smart Contract 1.1 Introduction to smart contract modeling Project Dovetail™ supports Hyperledger Composer modeling language to model smart contract assets and transactions, please refer to Composer Connector for support detail\n1.2 IOU Smart Contract We will use Visio Studio Code to create IOU smart contract model.\n create a workspace folder, e.g. tutorial create subfolders under tutorial  artifacts network  fabric corda   copy template project to the workspace, and rename the project as iou under folder iou/model, create a file iou.cto copy following resource definitions into iou.cto file  namespace com.example.iou import com.tibco.dovetail.system.* asset IOU identified by linearId extends LinearState { --\u0026gt; Party issuer --\u0026gt; Party owner o Amount amt } /* @InitiatedBy - arg0: comma delimited list of authorized participants in the format of $tx.path.to.participant, or * for any participant - arg1: optional, comma delimited list of required attributes that must exist in the initiator's certificate in the format of name=value. */ @InitiatedBy(\u0026quot;$tx.iou.issuer\u0026quot;) transaction IssueIOU { o IOU iou } @InitiatedBy(\u0026quot;$tx.iou.owner\u0026quot;) transaction TransferIOU { --\u0026gt; IOU iou //by reference because the asset is already on the ledger --\u0026gt; Party newOwner } /* @Query : mark transaction as query only */ @Query() transaction getIOU { o String linearId } @Query() transaction getIOUIssuedBy { o String issuerPartyId }   Run zip command from iou directory to package the iou project, it will create a iou.bna file in the tutorial folder   cd /path/to/iou\nzip -r ../iou.bna *\n 2. Import IOU Smart Contract Model  Start up Project Dovetail™ Studio, it will display web URL to use Go to a browser and open the Web Studio Go to Connections Tab \u0026gt; Add Connection \u0026gt; Select Composer Connector Give the connection a name, then \u0026ldquo;Browse\u0026rdquo; to find the iou.bna file, click \u0026ldquo;Save Model\u0026rdquo; button.  \n3. Implement IOU Smart Contract In this step, we will implement the 4 transactions defined in the smart contract model in Project Dovetail™ Studio. A completed iou smart contract is also available to be imported into the Studio, see step 7 for details.\n3.1 IssueIOU Transaction  Go to Apps Tab \u0026gt; Create to create a new Application \u0026ldquo;IOU\u0026rdquo; Create a flow \u0026gt; flow name \u0026ldquo;IssueIOU\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; Select \u0026ldquo;SmartContract TXN Trigger\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; Select \u0026ldquo;IOU\u0026rdquo; from model dropdown \u0026gt; Select \u0026ldquo;com.example.iou.IssueIOU\u0026rdquo; from transaction dropdown \u0026gt; Click \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo; button We will add a logger activity, ledger activity and response activity. We will also validate input before writing to ledger.  \n3.2 TransferIOU Transaction  Create a new flow to implement TransferIOU transaction \n  3.3 getIOU Transaction  Create a new flow to implement getIOU transaction \n  3.4 getIOUIssuedBy Transaction  Create a new flow to implement getIOUIssuedBy transaction We use \u0026ldquo;Custom Query\u0026rdquo; activity to query the ledger. This activity is NOT blockchain agnostic  define a input parameter \u0026ldquo;issuerId\u0026rdquo; define blochchain specific query string, use _$paramName for input substitution, in this example, we use Hyperledger Fabric CouchDB query syntax *** During the mapping of transaction response, you will notice tht \u0026ldquo;array.\u0026rdquo; is underlined with a red line, it is a UI validation error because Project Dovetail™ Studio UI does not support function yet, the error has no impact to runtime. Function will be supported in the very near future.   \n4. Export IOU Smart Contract Application  Go to IOU application Click on \u0026ldquo;Export app\u0026rdquo; button, save the file IOU.json to artifacts folder  5. Generate Blockchain Artifacts 5.1 Hyperledger Fabric Run following command from tutorial directory Hyperledger Fabric chaincode is written to tutorial/artifacts/hlf folder\nFor testing, transaction security support is not enabled.\n /path/to/dovetail-cli contract generate -b fabric -m artifacts/IOU.json -v 1.0.0 -t artifacts/\n 5.2 R3 Corda Run following command from tutorial directory, R3 Corda contract is written to tutorial/artifacts/corda folder, put kotlin-IOU-1.0.0.jar on your classpath to develop your CorDapp. A sample IOUApp has been created and availble here\n /path/to/dovetail-cli contract generate -b corda -m artifacts/IOU.json -v 1.0.0 -t artifacts/ \u0026ndash;namespace com.example.iou\n 6. Test IOU Smart Contract 6.1 Hyperledger Fabric  Copy sample Hyperledger Fabric Network to your network/fabric directory Follow instructions here, assuing you are running commands from fabric directory.  6.2 R3 Corda  Copy sample R3 CorDapp to network/corda directory Follow instructions here  7. Import an existing application  You can import an application into Project Dovetail™ Studio  Go to Project Dovetail™ Studio If you haven\u0026rsquo;t import iou.bna file from Connections tab, you can do so now following step 2 in this document Create a new Application \u0026ldquo;IOUImport\u0026rdquo;, click on \u0026ldquo;Import\u0026rdquo; button, use this IOU.json   \n"
