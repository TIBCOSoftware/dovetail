However, generally speaking, smart contracts (at least from an enterprise / permissioned perspective) may be thought of as application or business logic (defined in code) that runs within the context of a blockchain network itself. The idea is to automate the processing of blockchain transactions across the network, use the logic to determine if a transaction will get written to the ledger, and to maintain accuracy, compliance, and trust. In essence, smart contracts represent a method for controlling how changes are made to the underlying blockchain, in a non-centralized and (potentially) untrustworthy environment. Supply chain transaction tracking, healthcare revenue cycle management, consumer contract execution, and government interactions are all areas in which smart contracts (business logic) may be applied. Remember, however, that \"smart contracts\" are not necessarily \"smart\" (depends on the code) nor \"contracts\" (as they may not be viewed as legal contracts). Thus, the term can be a bit misleading :) \r\r\r\r\r\r\rMore Details about this Initiative here TIBCO LABS™ -Project Dovetail™ Wiki, on \r\r\r\r\rTIBCO LABS™ is a program designed to provide customers and partners with a mechanism for actively participating in TIBCO’s history of innovation.

Project Dovetail™ by TIBCO LABS™ addresses these issues by providing a graphical interface for modeling smart contracts, making them easier to write, visualize, test, and audit, all without deep programming experience.\n\r\r\r\rLogic is abstracted from low-level code, and contracts can be developed for different blockchain stacks with little or no code. On-chain and off-chain computation can become more seamless, time to market is improved, and the risk of technology lock-in is reduced. Project Dovetail makes your smart contracts smarter.\n\r\r\r\r\r\rGet Started\rLet’s start your Dovetail journey!\nRead more …\n\r\r\rLabs\rLabs provide you with guides, tutorials and code samples and will help you work through building and deploying Dovetail smart contracts.\nRead more …\n\r\r\rSource Code\rThe whole Project consists of the some sub-projects as separate repos.\nRead more …\n\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\rContact us!\rReach us for more details, or engage us today !\nRead more …\n\r\r\rContributions welcome!\rWe do a Pull Request contributions workflow on GitHub.
